# CPP-TicTacToe-Implementation
This C++ program represents a console-based implementation of the classic game, Tic Tac Tor game.
where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game continues until one player successfully aligns three markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full, resulting in a draw.
Features:                     *Console Interface: Allows players to input moves via the console.   *Player Turns: Alternating turns between 'X' and 'O'.               *Win Detection: Checks rows, columns, and diagonals for a winning pattern.                         *Draw Detection: Identifies a draw condition when the board is full without a winner.
Usage:                         *Compile the Code:Use a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) to compile the tictactoe.cpp file.                *Run the Executable:Execute the compiled code to start the game.    *Input Moves:Players input their moves by specifying row and column numbers.The game validates input and updates the board accordingly.    *End of Game:Upon a win or draw, the game ends, and the outcome is displayed.
Purpose:This code serves as a simple and educational implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. It demonstrates fundamental game logic, input validation, and console-based interaction.
Files Included:         tictactoe.cpp: Contains the C++ code for the Tic Tac Toe game.    README.md: This file providing information about the project.
